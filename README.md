# Wireless Quadcopter (Drone) Project

**Developed under Prof. Joseph John, 2024 â€” Electrical Department, IIT Bombay**

This project involves the design and development of a wireless quadcopter (drone) controlled via an ESP32 microcontroller, enabling real-time remote operation without the need for a traditional controller.

## Features:
- **Wireless Communication**: Controlled through ESP32 microcontroller for real-time wireless operation.
- **Signal Processing**: Implemented with an ESP8266 module to ensure seamless connectivity using the Remote XY app.
- **Custom Control Protocols**: Designed for stable flight and responsive maneuverability, ensuring enhanced performance under varying conditions.
